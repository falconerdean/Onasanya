### Website & Hosting Package ($49/month for the first year)

As we discussed, our goal is to provide a professional, high-quality website without the large upfront cost. We do this by leveraging modern templates and AI, which allows us to offer a comprehensive package at a simple monthly rate.

**What's included:**

*   **Website Design & Development:** A professionally designed, mobile-friendly website tailored to your practice.
*   **Two Rounds of Revisions:** We'll work with you to make sure the site looks and feels right for your brand.
*   **Secure Hosting:** Fast, reliable, and secure website hosting is included.
*   **Ongoing Maintenance & Updates:** All technical updates, security patches, and software updates are handled by us.
*   **Content Updates:** Need to change text, update your headshot, or add a new service? Just send us an emailâ€”it's all included. You can even add new pages to the site.

### Additional Services

You also asked about a few other services to help grow your practice. Here is a breakdown of those options:

*   **Professional Email Setup ($50 one-time fee):** We can help you set up a professional email address like `yemi@ingredientstherapyservices.com` through Google Workspace. While this is something you can do on your own, we're happy to manage the setup for you if you prefer.
*   **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):**
    *   **Included:** Your website is built with foundational SEO best practices right out of the box. This includes proper keyword usage, mobile optimization, fast page speeds, and a structure that search engines like Google can easily understand.
    *   **Active SEO (Starts at $300/month):** This involves more intensive, ongoing activities like building backlinks and outreach to other websites. As we discussed, while we offer this, I genuinely believe your time and money are better spent initially on optimizing your Psychology Today profile and building your referral network directly. The foundational SEO included with your site provides a strong starting point.
*   **Social Media Integration:** We can easily add links to any of your professional social media profiles on the website.

I look forward to the possibility of working together.
