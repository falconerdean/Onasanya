_**User**_

Please update the @package.json file to reflect this repository: @https://github.com/falconerdean/Onasanya 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the package.json file to reflect the GitHub repository information. I'll use the search_replace tool to make the necessary changes.

Let me read the current package.json file first to make the appropriate updates:

The main changes needed are:
1. Update the name to match the repository name "Onasanya"
2. Add repository field to link to the GitHub repo
3. Add author information

I'll make these changes:

I've updated the package.json file with the following changes:
1. Changed the package name from "nextjs" to "onasanya" (using lowercase as per npm naming conventions)
2. Added the repository field pointing to your GitHub repository
3. Added the author field with your name

The rest of the package.json file remains unchanged since the dependencies and scripts are still valid for your project.

Let me verify if there are any linting issues with these changes:

Great! The package.json file has been successfully updated to reflect your GitHub repository information and there are no linting issues. The changes maintain all your existing dependencies and scripts while adding the proper repository metadata.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

Please review the @README.md, don't take any action, just get the context for what this app does.  

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the README.md to understand the context of this application.

Based on the README.md, this is a professional therapy practice website built with Next.js. Here's the key context:

Business Purpose:
1. It's a digital storefront for a therapy/counseling practice
2. Primary goals:
   - Attract and inform potential therapy clients
   - Showcase mental health services (relationship counseling, infidelity recovery, trauma treatment)
   - Generate leads through consultation bookings
   - Establish therapist credibility through credentials and testimonials
   - Provide an accessible, calming user experience

Technical Architecture:
1. Built as a Next.js application with TypeScript
2. Data-driven architecture where all content (therapist profiles, services, testimonials) is managed through a central configuration file (`data/augustadvice.ts`)
3. Key components:
   - `HeroSection`: Main landing area with background image and CTA
   - `ServicesSection`: Grid display of therapy services
   - `ServiceCard`: Reusable component for individual service displays
   - `FounderSection`: Therapist bio and credentials
   - `OrganizationsMarquee`: Scrolling display of professional affiliations
   - `CtaBanner`: Lead generation component with contact CTAs

The README also documents some interesting bug fixes around image handling in Next.js and data structure issues, showing it's an actively maintained project with careful attention to TypeScript type safety and Next.js best practices.

Would you like me to take any specific actions with this understanding of the application?
