_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the package.json file to reflect the GitHub repository information. I'll use the search_replace tool to make the necessary changes.

Let me read the current package.json file first to make the appropriate updates:

The main changes needed are:
1. Update the name to match the repository name "Onasanya"
2. Add repository field to link to the GitHub repo
3. Add author information

I'll make these changes:

I've updated the package.json file with the following changes:
1. Changed the package name from "nextjs" to "onasanya" (using lowercase as per npm naming conventions)
2. Added the repository field pointing to your GitHub repository
3. Added the author field with your name

The rest of the package.json file remains unchanged since the dependencies and scripts are still valid for your project.

Let me verify if there are any linting issues with these changes:

Great! The package.json file has been successfully updated to reflect your GitHub repository information and there are no linting issues. The changes maintain all your existing dependencies and scripts while adding the proper repository metadata.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?
